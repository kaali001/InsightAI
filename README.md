## 🎯 Objective

**InsightAI** is an AI-powered feedback analysis tool designed to **automatically detect, cluster, and summarize user-reported issues** from app reviews, product feedback, or support comments.

Manual feedback review is slow, biased, and inefficient. InsightAI leverages GenAI to help product teams, developers, and support managers **quickly understand pain points** and make informed decisions.

| Feature | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| 🔍 **Automated Clustering** | Groups similar user feedback into meaningful issue categories using unsupervised NLP techniques (e.g., BERTopic). |
| 🧾 **AI-Generated Summaries** | Each issue cluster is summarized using LLMs to provide a concise, human-readable description. |
| 📊 **Visual Feedback Dashboard** | Real-time UI for viewing top issues, sentiment distribution, and user pain points. |
| 💬 **Sentiment Analysis** | Tags each feedback as Positive, Neutral, or Negative to assess urgency and tone. |
| 📤 **Upload CSV/JSON** | Supports uploading of feedback datasets directly from app reviews, forms, or exports. |
| 📥 **Export Reports** | Download a clean summary of issue clusters as PDF or Excel for internal review. |
