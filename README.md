![InsightAI Banner](https://img.shields.io/badge/GenAI-Feedback--Summarizer-blueviolet?style=for-the-badge)  
> ✨ Your smart assistant for extracting insights from user feedback ✨

---

## 🎯 Objective

**InsightAI** is an AI-powered feedback analysis tool designed to **automatically detect, cluster, and summarize user-reported issues** from app reviews, product feedback, or support comments.

Manual feedback review is slow, biased, and inefficient. InsightAI leverages GenAI to help product teams, developers, and support managers **quickly understand pain points** and make informed decisions.
